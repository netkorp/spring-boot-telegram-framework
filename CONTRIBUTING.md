# Introduction

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to [Spring Boot Telegram Framework](https://github.com/netkorp/spring-boot-telegram-framework). We need volunteers like you to make this project come to fruition and become a great tool.

We are really glad you are reading this. Feel welcome and read the following sections to learn how to contribute to this project. We expect you and all members of our community to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

There are many ways to contribute. For example, you might:

1. Add new features or make improvements to the Framework.
2. Fix bugs you've found in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/netkorp/spring-boot-telegram-framework/issues).
3. Add documentation to the [README](README.md) or [Wiki](https://github.com/netkorp/spring-boot-telegram-framework/wiki).

# Reporting Issues

When reporting an issue, please:

1. Describe the matter (bugs, new features, improvements, ...) with a clear and concise description of what it is.
2. Indicate the steps to reproduce the behavior.
3. List the Framework's version/OS/Java version you are using and any relevant information about your application (see the templates [here](https://github.com/netkorp/spring-boot-telegram-framework/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)).
4. Describe what behavior you are seeing or expecting.

Please, **DO NOT** use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/netkorp/spring-boot-telegram-framework/issues) for support questions. Our [group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/spring-boot-telegram-framework) is a better place for such discussions.

# Contributing

For a better experience contributing to our project, we recommend check this tips out:

1. Before creating a new issue, make sure there is not a similar issue already created for avoiding duplicates.
2. Create issues for any change you want to make. Discuss things (see our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)) and get community feedback.
3. We use **semantic version** for the Framework's versioning. If you consider that the version must be changed, please stick to this [guide](https://semver.org/). To change the version we recommend to use this command in the root of the project: `mvn versions:set -DnewVersion="version here"`.

Contributions are welcome via [Github pull requests](https://github.com/netkorp/spring-boot-telegram-framework/pulls). For all contributions, please respect the following guidelines:

1. Each pull request (PR) must be associated to an open [issue](https://github.com/netkorp/spring-boot-telegram-framework/issues). Make sure there is one open issue with feedback from the community before creating the PR.
2. Each PR must implement **ONE** feature or bugfix. If you want to add more than one thing, submit more than one PR.
3. For creating a new PR, please follow this [guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request).
4. Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to solve the issue.
5. Do not commit files with any tokens/API keys/passwords/private data. PRs with this kind of data won't be merged.

# Code review process

Code review takes place in [Github pull requests](https://github.com/netkorp/spring-boot-telegram-framework/pulls). Once you open a PR, the project maintainers will review your code and provide you with any comments they might have. The requested changes will be merged into the project's `master` branch, after the PR gets one +1 (al least) from the project maintainers. After a month without activity, the PR will be closed.
